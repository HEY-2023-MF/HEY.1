	<p class="lead">We are a group of five members of the morning and evening shift of ¡Supérate! Hilasal, our trajectory as a team begins when a challenge was put in front of us, "Microsoft 365 Hackathon", where our objective was to create a mobile application that will benefit the Center in specific areas. <br><br>After thinking about several ideas for a week with our guidance teacher, we came to a conclusion, we would create an application that would help the youngest members of the Center to organize their time and activities, we took this into consideration for our situation last year, where we did not we knew exactly how to do so that we had a productive time and one to rest. <br><br>It was a long journey where we had to overcome many obstacles both personally and as a group, there were nights where we had to work harder, meetings whenever we could to see the progress of the application and its functionality, these actions were complemented by the deliveries that we should do. <br><br>Until the day came when we had to make the final delivery, a video in which we had to explain about our application incorporating the suggestions that our teachers had made us, this file would be seen by the final juries, after this fact it was revealed the winner among the ten applications of the center. <br><br>Although we were not the selected ones, we are and we were very happy with the final result of our application, so without further ado, we present you some screenshots of our Hey! application.</p>
